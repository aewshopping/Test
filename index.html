As the sound of the victor’s footsteps slowly faded into the distance, a palpable sense of disbelief at what had just occurred hung over the Gryphon, the crowd stupefied by the savagery of what it had witnessed.  Stunned silence was at first punctuated only by a thickset man quietly vomiting through his fingers.  From somewhere, the sound of a sobbing child could be heard.  Then a woman stood slowly, her shaking finger pointing at Webb’s abandoned banana, recumbent astride the ‘T’.  She began tearing at her hair, eyes becoming wild with horror as her voice reached a screeching crescendo:
 
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this!  This should never have happened!”
 
Then a seat, ripped from the viewing gallery, landed with a clatter on the court.  And all hell broke loose..
 
To understand what happened to cause the ensuing riot, one has to cast his mind back to a distant time and place. Romania in the 1980s was a country suffering under the brutal rule of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, crippling external debts giving rise to austerity which caused economic stagnation all the way from Timisoara in the West to Constanta in the East.  Living standards had plummeted; heating and hot water became the preserve of the few, while the majority rolled around in their own filth.  It was in Cosoveni Village Orphanage in Sud-Vest Oltenia that the young Adrian Webb and Connor Mihais (as he was then known) grew up together, and where the greatest rivalry in the history of squash was forged.  The Matron, a wizened old thing named Mariana Creanga, was sadistic but fair, modelling herself on the dictator's wife, Elena, whose portrait adorned every wall.  Webb and Mihais, born just a week apart, lived well on a diet of cabbage peel and potato leaves and wanted for nothing.  When the orphanage candle was extinguished at bedtime, Webb studied trigonometry, algebra, and Euclidean geometry while Mihais stubbed his cigarettes out on kittens and volleyed frogs at the dormitory wall, howling with laughter as they burst.
 
Mihais and Webb were rivals almost from the beginning.  It wasn't unusual for an argument between the pair to result in a bloodied nose for Webb, and many was the minor disagreement that saw Mihais take a plough handle to Webb's face and ribs.  But friends they were, and friends they would remain.  Though Mihais never sought Webb's help with Pythagorean theory or reading, the quiet, studious Webb would always turn to the vulgar, loutish Mihais for advice on whittling sticks, gutting rats and the like.  As the years slipped by, Mihais' thuggish behaviour did not go unnoticed by the Departamentul Securității Statului, and at aged 6 he became Romania's youngest ever recruit to the secret police to much public fanfare, an opinion piece in Scînteia declaring him a "shining example of Romanian manhood, in the mould of Ion Luca Caragiale, Mihai Viteazul, Aurel Vlaicu and Gheorghe Hagi."  The popular press bestowed on Mihais the affectionate moniker 'Mad Dog' ('Cainele Nebun') in recognition of the imaginative ways he was rumoured to obtain confessions from counter-revolutionaries.  He earned the honourary title 'Hero of Socialist Labour' soon thereafter, commandeering a tractor and driving 230 kilometres to Bucharest to receive his medal from none other than the Conducător himself, Nicolae Ceausescu.
 
While Mihais was rising through the ranks of the Romanian state apparatus, Webb concentrated on his studies, winning a scholarship to Alexandru Ioan Cuza University where he excelled in Mathematics, obtaining a level 10 Diplomă de Bacalaureat.  Perhaps it was jealousy or perhaps it was Webb's propensity to display bourgeois tendencies such as washing and reading, but either way Mihais denounced Webb, then aged 6 and a half, as an enemy of the people, and Webb was faced with a choice of either defecting to the West or listening to Romanian folk music until he confessed to his crimes.
 
As might be expected, Webb planned his escape meticulously.  First he underwent gender reassignment surgery and assumed the identity of well-known Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci.  Then, with 6 other orphans all masquerading as gymnasts, he crossed the border into Hungary from where he made his way to the American embassy in Austria.  Eventually arriving in New York, Webb reluctantly stopped pretending to be Nadia Comaneci and took up squash.  Armed with his knowledge of angles, he became American national champion just shy of his 7th birthday.
 
Back in Cosoveni Mihais flew into a rage and vowed to exact revenge on his former friend and fascist agitator for his treachery.  He bought himself a squash racquet and dared to dream of the day he would face and destroy Webb on court.  News of Webb's exploits spread throughout Romania, illegal radio stations such as Radio Free Europe and Voice of America bringing squash commentary to the masses, and Webb became a hero to the long-suffering and the downtrodden throughout the land.  Despite the efforts of Ceausescu, the people- imbued with hope and inspired by Webb- rose up against the oppressor and in December 1989 smashed the system that had dominated them since 1947.
 
Given Mihais' association with the fallen regime, he had had no choice but to flee.  With a baying mob hard on his heels, like Webb just months before him and in a twist of poetic irony, he himself escaped across the border into Hungary.  But it was not New York, but Brighouse where Mihais claimed asylum, and where he changed his name to Michaels and learned to read and write.  Despite no one caring any more, Michaels spent the next 28 years pestering Webb on Myspace for a game of squash to settle old scores.  Webb only relented and agreed to play Michaels on 22 March 2017 because he happened to be in Leeds that day signing copies of his autobiography in Waterstones and thought it would be churlish to refuse.  Even though Michaels paid some second-rate actors to cause a bit of a scene following the game, the game itself was an utter anticlimax, Webb unsurprisingly thrashing Michaels 3-0.
 
The end.
